# Accomplishment Diary

An app to record daily planned/ completed tasks (i.e. "accomplishments") to help with evaluating personal performance.

## First Time Setup

- You should have `python3` (3.6+), `node`, and `npm` installed.
- Run `scripts/setup.sh` from repo root.
    - This will install all `node`/ `python` dependencies, and create a Python virtualenv.
    - This will also install git hooks, which do style checks for the repo.
